# Write a Python program to store marks scored in subject “Fundamental of Data
# Structure” by N students in the class. Write functions to compute following:
# a)The average score of class
# b)Highest score and lowest score of class
# c)Count of students who were absent for the test
# d)Display mark with highest frequency
